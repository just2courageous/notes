# Useful CLI Commands

- **`ls`**: List files. Use the `-a` option to show all files, including hidden ones, and `-l` to show detailed information like file sizes and timestamps.

- **`cat`**: Display the content of a file. It shows the full text of the file in the terminal.
  - Example: `cat filename.txt` will display the content of `filename.txt`.
  - You can also concatenate files by listing multiple files after `cat`: 
    ```
    cat file1.txt file2.txt
    ```

These are the main commands we used in previous labs for navigating and viewing files.
